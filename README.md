Ten Ideas a Day
===============

This project comes out of a podcast episode that I was listening to.
An episode from James Altucher, and also an article or two he wrote.
Well, from this guy I find very interesting to listen to, and who is doing things I'd like to be doing but am not. Damn.
Anyway, any journey starts with a first step and this will be it.
Yeah, this readme. Hm. Ok, what is it all about?

Basically, getting into the habit of writing down 10 ideas a day.
Can be about anything, but has to be 10.
And if you have a hard time coming to 10, well, make it 20.
Yes, 20. So that 10 doens't feel like that hard limit that blocks the creative juices.

Here is the plan:

- make a file for each day (named like yyyy-mm-dd_ideas.md)
- write down the contents with one heading per idea (and some content down there)
- add the file to the project
- commit and push to GH.

And then let's see how it goes.

For keeping track, I'll use Habitica and add a "daily" to it. Yeah, let's add more gamification to my life.
